# HTML & CSS Learning Tips
Here are some tips and best practices to help you effectively learn and practice HTML and CSS:

### 1. Memorize Concepts, Reference Syntax
You don't need to memorize every single property, but you do need to internalize the core behaviors. If you understand how these work, you can always look up the code later:

- **The Box Model:** Every element is a box with margin, border, padding, and content. If you don't "get" this, nothing will ever align correctly.

- **The "Flow":** How block elements (like div) stack vertically vs. how inline elements (like span) sit side-by-side.

- **Positioning:** Relative vs. Absolute vs. Fixed. (This confuses everyone at first. Master it, and you are ahead of 80% of beginners).

### 2. Learn Your "Top 20"
While you shouldn't rote memorize, you will naturally memorize the things you use every day just by repetition.

- **HTML:** You will use `<div>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<input>`, `<form>`, `<button>`, and semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>` 95% of the time. The weird tags (like `<samp>` or `<kbd>`)? Look them up if you ever need them.

- **CSS:** You will constantly use `display` (flex/grid), `margin`, `padding`, `color`, `background`, `font-size`, and `width`/`height`.

### 3. Your Best Friend is MDN
The [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/) is the bible of web development.
- **Amateur move:** Memorizing exactly how the border-radius shorthand works.
- **Pro move:** Typing "MDN border radius" into Google and reading the documentation in 10 seconds.
- **Make it a habit:** to read the documentation, not just copy-paste the solution.
