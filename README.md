# HTML & CSS Course Practice

This repository contains my code and practice exercises from the [HTML & CSS Course by SuperSimpleDev](https://github.com/SuperSimpleDev/html-css-course/).

The main objective of this project is to learn web development fundamentals by building a replica of the YouTube website, along with various smaller exercises to master specific concepts.

## Projects

### 1. YouTube Clone
The core project of this course. It replicates the layout and styling of the YouTube homepage.
- **File:** `youtube.html`
- **Key Features:**
  - **Header Section:** Created using Flexbox for aligning the menu, search bar, and user icons.
  - **Video Grid:** Implemented using CSS Grid to display video thumbnails and details in a responsive layout.
  - **Styling:** Organized into separate CSS files (`general.css`, `header.css`, `video.css`) for better maintainability.

### 2. Concept Practice
Dedicated files for experimenting with specific CSS layout modules.
- **Flexbox:** `flexbox.html` - Practice with `display: flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, etc.
- **CSS Grid:** `grid.html` - Practice with `display: grid`, `grid-template-columns`, etc.

### 3. Intro to HTML Exercises
A collection of progressive exercises located in the `Intro-to-html/` folder, covering:
- Basic HTML elements (Buttons, Text)
- CSS Box Model (Margins, Padding, Borders)
- Nested Layouts technique
- Styling exercises (`exercise-1.html` through `exercise-13.html`)

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and elements.
- **CSS3**: Modern layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid), styling, and responsiveness.

## How to View
You can open any of the `.html` files directly in your web browser to view the results.
